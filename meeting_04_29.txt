Make a landing page that lets someone select a showcase.
Options: (W) Comm, (F2F) Comm, Priority 1 Queen.
Only show circle showcase on landing page, and link to it, at what point the menu comes up.

Possibly include snapshot.


Once we show  a category of  algorithms, we allow them to be able to compare.
On hover, show type of comm explanation.
On click, show the algorithms themselves.

Go to a second page.
Then show Field, Graph, Alg. Steps, on second page.

Documentation can usually show on multiple pages.

Take out WC Visualizer.

The comparator is in the showcase.

TikZ UML
Clean up classes, and MAKE BASIC UML diagram.
Include in doc.

Robots Evacuation  -> Search-and-Evacuation Algorithms (for shape type)




ALGORITHMS:

Edit Alg. C image to show angle PHI.
Remove hover data boxes.
Indicate Queen more clearly on graph colors.
Red as color for queen from here on out.
Implement IGNORE so that servants don't move toward exit in priority algs.
(optionally implement wait to use as ignore.)


Correct all stuff in algorithms, and reshape pages.
