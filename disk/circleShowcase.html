                The Main 2 panels you will see below are both different visual representations of the same algorithm.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p style="font-size: 1.25em;">
                The panel on the left, which we refer to as the "Field" shows the actual position of the robots at
                any given time on their trajectories.
                The reference point of 0 degrees occurs at x=1 on the unit disk shown below.
                Before an algorithm starts, you must select a location for the exit by hovering around the disk, and clicking
                when you find a suitable exit location. The algorithm will then begin.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p style="font-size: 1.25em;">
                The panel on the right, which we refer to as the "Graph", show the absolute distance of each robot from the current
                exit position, in units.
                The current time and number of frames that the animation has played for will be displayed in the top left.
                Below the time, are four buttons which can be used to replay, slow, rewind, and stop the animation playback,
                once it has finished. Clicking "Slow" more than once can slow the animation down more
                in whichever direction it is currently playing.
                In the top right of the Graph is the robot legend. This shows the Robot ID number, color, and whether or not the robot is
                designated as priority. If it is a priority robot, it will be shown with a (P).
            </p>
            <br />

            <p style="font-size: 1.25em;">
                Finally, when there priority robots in the algorithm, an extra panel will show below the Field and Graph.
                This is a special graph that we call the Worst Case Graph.
                It shows the distance of the priority from one of the servants in a simulation of the algorithm where no exit is present.
                This graph allows us to see the time it would take the algorithm to finish, based on the frame number.
                If the SERVANT were to find the exit on any of the given frame numbers, the "Time to Finish" datapoint
                will show us the worst case time that the algorithm would finish based on how far the priority currently
                is from the servant which found the exit.

    <!--
    <p>
        This problem is being analyzed to determine the optimal time of mobile agents finding an exit.
        This optimization is an attempt to find the lower bound of possibility of completing the task, given
        any discrete variables. In other words, the lower bound is not simply the 'shortest time to complete the task,'
        but instead the shortest amount of time to complete the task when there are obstacles such as
        an unknown exit location (to the agents searching for it). Finding the lower bound is an optimization problem,
        and as such, we try to find different strategies to optimize the search and evacuation procedure.

            In this algorithm, we designate two of the robots as priority, and only one as the servant.
            The algorithm terminates when at least one of the priority robots finds the exit.
            The algorithm takes one argument, Q(α). α is the angle at which one servant and one priority will travel toward the perimeter.
            We will denote the servant as S, and the two priority robots as P1 and P2.

                    P2 will travel to the perimeter at angle 0.

                <li>
                    P1 travels counter-clockwise until it finds the exit. P2 travels counter-clockwise until it finds the exit. Finally, S travels clockwise until it finds the exit.

        We can show that this algorithm has an upper bound of 3.55 time units for angle α = 14π/9 - 2√3/3. The two worst-cases for the exit location in this
        algorithm are: 2π - θ for some very small θ, or π - ((6√3 - 2)/9).
