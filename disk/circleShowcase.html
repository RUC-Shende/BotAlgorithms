        This problem is being analyzed to determine the optimal time of mobile agents finding an exit.
        This optimization is an attempt to find the lower bound of possibility of completing the task, given
        any discrete variables. In other words, the lower bound is not simply the 'shortest time to complete the task,'
        but instead the shortest amount of time to complete the task when there are obstacles such as
        an unknown exit location (to the agents searching for it). Finding the lower bound is an optimization problem,
        and as such, we try to find different strategies to optimize the search and evacuation procedure.

        This algorithm takes two arguments, Q(α, β): α being this arc length that the priority robot will take until it makes a small detour, β being the angle (α + β) on the unit disk that the priority robot travels to,
        creating a chord. After this, the priority robot will travel in the opposite direction, back towards the point where it originally made the detour.

        This algorithm takes two arguments, Q(α, ρ): α being the angle the priority robot will travel before moving directly across the disk to point
        ρ, which is the y-value of the point K(α/2, ρ). This is the point where the priority will diverge and travel toward the angle -α/2 on the disk.
        We will denote the servants in this algorithm as S1 and S2, and the priority as P.

                In this algorithm, we designate two of the robots as priority, and only one as the servant.
                The algorithm terminates when at least one of the priority robots finds the exit.
                The algorithm takes one argument, Q(α). α is the angle at which one servant and one priority will travel toward the perimeter.
                We will denote the servant as S, and the two priority robots as P1 and P2.
                14*pi/9 - 2*sqrt(3)/3
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The robots S and P1 will travel to the perimeter at <span class="tooltip">angle α.<span class="tooltiptext">This is usually an angle located between (π, 3π/2)</span></span>
                        P2 will travel to the perimeter at angle 0.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        P1 travels counter-clockwise until it finds the exit. P2 travels counter-clockwise until it finds the exit. Finally, S travels clockwise until it finds the exit.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br />

                We can show that this algorithm has an upper bound of 3.55 time units for angle α = 14π/9 - 2√3/3. The two worst-cases for the exit location in this
                algorithm are: 2π - θ for some very small θ, or π - ((6√3 - 2)/9).
