# (BETA) Algorithms for Evacuating Mobile Agents from an Area

Algorithms for mobile agents in a specific area to search for an exit along a perimeter and
evacuate, based on wireless and non-wireless communication models. These algorithms will be saved and loaded by the program as `.icl` files, which will be read in by the application.

Example algorithms will be sorted into directories based on the type of area that the algorithm explores.
Subdirectories will denote the type of communication model being used for the algorithm.

The beta branch is for a version of ICL Anim using canvases instead of SVG. This proved to have much better loading times for large number of robots (>100), but low resolution quality overall.
We decided to stick with higher resolution simulations as the intended number of robots will not usually be more than 20-30.
