# Bot Algorithms forEvacuating Mobile Agents from an Area

Algorithms for mobile agents in a specific area to search for an exit along a perimeter and
evacuate, based on wireless and non-wireless communication models. 

Algorithms will be sorted into directories based on the type of area that the algorithm explores.
Subdirectories will denote the type of communication model being used for the algorithm.
