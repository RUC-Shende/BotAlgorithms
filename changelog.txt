          Pursue function now pursues closest.
          Pursue function now claims target; prevents same target.
          Pursue function has caught target, if within half a frame of movement.
          Exit found, if within half a frame of movement.

08/13/18: F2F showcase uses ICL Reader Version 21 framework.
          Explanation for algorithm C added.
          Explanation for triangular detour added.
          Added more responsive design to the F2Fshowcase.
          TODO: ChoosExit slightly malfunctions now that the SVG is centered
          @@@@ Dave if you read this please look at f2fshowcase.js @@@@

08/14/18: F2F Showcase Visual/QOL updates -
          Links to algorithms focus on the description when clicked.
          More responsive design added.
          Updated animation controllers to look more natural.

          TODO: Animation slider crashes when clicked BEFORE animation starts.
          TODO: Bot selector crashes when clicked before animation starts.

08/16/18: ICL Reader V22
          Intercept implemented
          Hovering over bot, shows its instructions


08/24/18: ICL Reader V23
          @@@@ Response to 08/13/18 @@@@
                  - Turns out mouse local to svg doesn't fix any of the problems, apologies.
          Using mouse local to the svg, didn't work in fixing padding, zooming, or scrolling errors.
          Same version from Wednesday, been busy and forgot to upload this one.
          Now hovering over bot, "highlights" the bot and their lines.
          When a bot finds the exit, a line is drawn on the graph.
          When all bots are at the exit, a line is drawn on the graph.
          First graph load is pre-generated.

08/27/18: ICL Reader V24
          Documentation added

08/30/18: ICL Reader V25
          Now is a nearly empty html file, that calls in ICLAnim.js, and ICLFashion.css.

          ICL Anim V2
          All functions are now methods.
          All fucctions only require value.
          Fixed some function errors.
          Fixed exit funtions with wireless.
          Removed the fxs and efxs objects.

09/12/18: F2F Showcase V1.2
          The showcase now features algorithms A, B, and C in working order.
          Users can now click on an algorithm description to see its explanation,
          and the algorithm will reset and change its instructions.

          Documents V2
          Included (over the past few weeks) documentation for all the Tourist
          class functions and variables, as well as references to the papers we
          read to get the algorithms instructions.

09/14/18: ICLAnim V4, ICLFashion(My edits), ICLReader
          ICLAnim
                    Code reduction
                    Some on functions changed to actual function
          ICLFashion
                    svg is only real change
          ICLReader
                    now holds most of the visuals now.

10/05/18: Circle Showcase v1.0
          CircleShowcase:
                    Included Algorithms Priority 1 and Priority 2
                    All algorithms run face-to-face AND wireless.
                    Select an algorithm from the side menu and see it run.
                    Add tabs for Priority 1 and 2.
                    Added names for each algorithm when changing.
        Circle and F2F:
                    Fixed a bug where loading an ICL file caused the program to crash.
                    Introduced a bug where sometimes the loaded ICL file will crash the program, but for a different reason.
                    TODO: need to determine where to put metadata in ICL file.
                    TODO: need to implement a priority attribute for tourists and use it to change the algorithm.
                    TODO: need to implement a way to identify priority by color. Might switch to set list of
                    contrasting colors soon.
        F2F is now one app, with 3 algorithms contained in it, A, B and C.
        Circle is now one app, with 10 total algorithms, F2F and Wireless A, B, C, P1, P2.
        Generated mp4 files demonstrating the app in motion, not included because filesizes.
        Included resources folder for pictures created so far.
        Moved old files to .old .
