\section{Preliminaries}

Algorithms of search-and-escape involve mobile agents (also called Robots)
searching in geometric domains, such as a closed disk, or convex polygon. By
working together and communicating with one another, these mobile agents search
the domain to find an exit hidden on the perimeter. Many different problems exist for
this topic, such as evacuating all agents, or only evacuating a specific subset of these
agents.

\subsection{Model}

All agents in this problem use the same coordinate system and operate in a closed
disk, all starting from the center. These agents' algorithms do not all have to be the same,
in fact to most efficiently search the circle, they must all be unique.
In our problem, we observe the Priority model of algorithms. In this model, a
subset of one or more agents (P) is defined as a Priority (or Queen) and the goal
of the algorithm is to evacuate a certain number of these Priority Agents. These
algorithms also include a certain number Helper agents (H), that simply assist in searching the circle
for the exit, for a total of (H + P) agents. The Helper agents are not typically required to evacuate.
Once an exit is found, whether by a Helper or a Priority,the agent may use
Wireless communication to immediately broadcast the exit's location and the finder's identity to all other agents.
Upon receiving this broadcasted location, any remaining Priority agents that
need to evacuate travel immediately to the exit and the algorithm terminates.
The cost of the algorithm is called the termination time, and is the total worst-case
time for the required subset of Priority agents to exit.
