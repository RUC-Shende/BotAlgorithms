Beginner's Guide to Javascript and D3.js

Hello future undergraduate research assistants, this is Chris and Dave.
This file is meant to help with understanding of javascript and D3 in
HTML, with some small code snippets, and examples of the snippets
together for some code examples. Each code snippet will go over (attempt
to) show every possible way to use, and why it's used, in a sense this
is a manual that is meant to be compact with tips, tricks, and weird
things that happen with it.

Boilerplate HTML
================

Copy and paste this to get a default HTML file:

.. code:: HTML

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body></body>
    </html>

Comments
========

-  HTML comments between <!-- and -->
-  // before javascript comments
-  JS multi-line comments between /\* and \*/

How To Load a Javascript File into HTML
=======================================

If the Javascript file looks like this:

.. code:: javascript

    example.js

    function main() {
        alert("Hello World!");
        return;
    }

Then the best way to load it into the HTML file is like this:

.. code:: HTML

    index.html

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <!-- Locally, same directory -->
            <script src="example.js">

            <!-- Different directory from parent directory -->
            <script src="../local/path/to/code/example.js">
        </body>
    </html>

Please note that once the Javascript file is loaded, it will only
execute when you tell it to, whether it be right away (from function
calls inside the file) or in a different script tag, as shown below:

.. code:: HTML

    index.html

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <!-- Locally, same directory -->
            <script src="example.js">

            <!-- Now that we have loaded in our 'example.js' we can use its functions. -->
            <!-- Not all '<script>' tags need a 'src' -->
            <!-- Any text between the tags will use JS syntax. HTML  syntax is invalid in here. -->
            <script>
                // Will Alert "Hello World!" as seen in the example.js file.
                main();
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>

Since D3.js is a library, we want to load it in before any of our local
code runs. We can do this by loading it in the header of the HTML, so
that it is included when any of our own Javascript runs in the body:

.. code:: HTML

    index.html

    <!doctype html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <!-- Using the same script tag, but this one gets loaded first. -->
            <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>
            <!-- Now we can safely use D3 methods in our body. -->
        </head>
        <body>
            <!-- Locally, same directory -->
            <script src="example.js">

            <!-- Now that we have loaded in our 'example.js' we can use its functions. -->
            <!-- Not all '<script>' tags need a 'src' -->
            <!-- Any text between the tags will use JS syntax. HTML  syntax is invalid in here. -->
            <script>
                // Will Alert "Hello World!" as seen in the example.js file.
                main();
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
