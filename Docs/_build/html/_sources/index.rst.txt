Intro
=====

This app was designed to simulate mobile agents, or robots, in an area, searching for an exit along the perimeter of the area.
The goal of this app is to allow users to test out different algorithms by writing their own instructions for the
robots, and try to decrease the lower bound of how long it takes for different numbers of robots to find the exit.

Getting Started
===============

To see the app in action, simply get the project from `Github
<https://github.com/dbushta/BotAlgorithms/>`_.
