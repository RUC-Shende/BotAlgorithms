\newblock{Introduction}{Introduction}{
        The purpose of our research is to study distributed search-and-evacuation algorithms.
        These algorithms involve mobile agents (or robots) searching in geometric domains, such as a closed disk or a convex polygon.
        By working together and communicating with one another, the mobile agents search for an exit hidden on the perimeter.
        The goal of our research is to create and study exit strategies that terminate as quickly as possible.

\newblock{Work}{Future Work}{
        This is an example of an algorithm that abstracts real world problems,
        where a specified subset of agents has to evacuate.
	    In the future we will study further distributed algorithms of search and evacuate on lines and polygons,
        or even topologies such as arbitrary finite graphs. To analyze these, we have created a web app that
        shows visualizations and helpful data of all of the algorithms that we have studied. Link to website: \textbf{https://bit.ly/2Vv85OJ}

	This algorithm has an upper bound of 3.55 time units in the worst case. We can achieve this time by sending \textbf{H}
    and \textbf{P2} out at an angle of $\alpha = 5 \pi / 9 - 2\sqrt3 /3$, and $\beta = ( \pi / 3 - \alpha) / 2$,
    so that both of the worst case time predictions are equal.

\newAlert{Conjectures}{Our Analysis}{
            In this algorithm, we observe two worst case situations. In one, \textbf{P2} travels the entire distance
            of its arc, until it reaches the exit a small distance before 0 radians.
            In the other, \textbf{H} finds the exit at a point such that the closest priority
            agent (\textbf{P1}) would have to travel along a chord to reach it.\vspace{0.5in}\hfill\break % MAKE A NEW LINE WITH A SPACE
            We analyze the case in which \textbf{H} finds the exit in the second quadrant, at angle $\pi - \beta$.
            Say that there is an angle of $\theta$ between \textbf{P1} and \textbf{H}, such that
            the shortest distance between the two agents is $\[ 2 \sin (\theta / 2)$. The angle $\theta$ that
            would produce the longest distance between \textbf{P1} and \textbf{H}, is $\theta = 2 \pi / 3$.
            Therefore, the termination time for the algorithm in this case is $\[ 1 + (\alpha + \beta) + 2 \sin (\theta / 2)$ in the worst case, where $\alpha + \beta$ is the
            circumferential distance already traveled by each agent.
            By trading off this worst case with the one in which \textbf{P2} finds the
            exit at a very small angle below 0, we arrived at a solution for these angles $\alpha$ and
            $\beta$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   TIPS  TO MAKE A NICE POSTER  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Common mistakes when compiling
% 1) There is an empty row in one of the blocks, remove it.
% 2) You forgot to close the brace } at the end of the block, close it.
% 3) The name of a block does not agree, for example you have \newSingle{Description}{\BlockDescription}
%                           and when you call it to form the main columns, you may have typed \SingleDescripption
%                           hence you should have typed  \SingleDescription, correct it.
% 4) It can not find a picture, perhaps you have it in the wrong folder.
% 5) Maybe it doesn't find mypostersettings.tex, it should be in the same folder as CoolPoster.tex
%
%
%%%%%  General Recomendations when typing your poster:
%%%%%  Your regular blocks MUST be short, two or three sentences each, see the examples above.
%%%%%  If your graph contains graphs, first genererate the pdf versions of each graph via LATEX,  then DVItoPS then PStoPDF
%%%%%                   as shown in the tex files contained in the folder mypics
